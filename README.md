Wildlife Safari AR
Wildlife Safari AR is an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experience built using Unity and Vuforia, designed to transport users into a virtual forest teeming with life. This project combines stunning 3D visuals of animals, a flowing waterfall, a serene pond, and a lush forest environment to create a captivating and educational adventure. As users explore the AR environment, they can interact with various elements, such as animals, to learn about their names, habitats, diets, and fun facts. The experience is enhanced by proximity-based interactions, where information about an animal is displayed when the user moves close to it, creating a seamless blend of exploration and learning.
